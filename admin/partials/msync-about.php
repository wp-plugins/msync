<h2>About</h2>

<p>MSync is a new plugin for WordPress that allows you to take advanced Marketo actions. You can immediately track leads, modify their data and push them to Marketo. Forms can also be created directly within WordPress posts and pages in the exact same fashion as if they were created within Marketo. The drag and drop simplicity is very user friendly and allows users to create custom fields and collect the precise information they need.</p>

<p>As Marketo silver partners, Magic Logix is aware of how important Marketing Automation is for both your marketing and sales teams. This plugin was created solely with a better user experience in mind for Marketo clients with WordPress based websites.</p>
